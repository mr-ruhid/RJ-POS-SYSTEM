**Step 1: Create .env File**

1. Let's create a .env file - this is where the password and login will be located

nano .env

2. Enter the following information on the blank screen that opens (set the password yourself):

```env
ADMIN_USER=mudir
ADMIN_PASS=M@qa123456

Then save (`Ctrl + X`, `Y`, `Enter`).

**Step 2: Download Library**

```bash
npm install dotenv

**Step 3: Restart the Server**

Restart PM2 to apply the change:

```bash
pm2 restart monitor

There is no longer a password in the code. The password is only hidden in the `.env` file on the server itself.
